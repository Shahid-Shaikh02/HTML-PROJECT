# Shodan Games

Shodan Games is a curated collection of browser-based games built and maintained by Shodan (Shahid Shaikh).  
This repository powers the live site at: [**https://shahid-shaikh02.github.io/shodan-games/**](https://shahid-shaikh02.github.io/shodan-games/)

## Overview

Shodan Games serves as a centralised hub to showcase, host, and iterate on multiple web games under a single, consistent experience.  
The platform is implemented using a lightweight, performant front‑end stack (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and a JSON‑driven configuration for game metadata and content.

Key characteristics:

- Centralised listing of multiple games with a unified UI and UX
- JSON-based configuration for game catalog and content
- Static, CDN‑friendly hosting via GitHub Pages
- Simple to extend, maintain, and iterate for future titles

## Features

- **Game catalog management**  
  - `games-list.json` contains metadata for each game (title, description, URLs, tags, etc.).  
  - Designed for easy addition, removal, or modification of games without changing core logic.

- **Dynamic front‑end**  
  - `index.html` provides the main landing page and layout shell.  
  - `script.js` dynamically loads and renders the games list, game details, and interactions from JSON.

- **Responsive styling**  
  - `style.css` implements a responsive layout compatible with modern desktop and mobile browsers.  
  - Focus on clean, minimal visual design to highlight games and thumbnails.

- **Error handling & routing**  
  - Custom `404.html` page for invalid or outdated links.  
  - Safe fallback behavior for missing or malformed game entries.

- **Static hosting & CI-friendly**  
  - Deployed via GitHub Pages with frequent updates.  
  - No backend dependency, suitable for low-latency global access.
